# HTMLGenerator
A custom HTML/CSS generator written in Java, compiled and tested in NetBeans 8.0.2, SDK-8u60

This was my first real programming project intially written in April/May of 2015.  Please feel free to extend it, clean it up, and have fun with it.  The goal of this project is simply to create a cool custom webpage generator and to learn along the way.  Thanks!

Cheers,

  Alex
